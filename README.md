# PacMan-Eating-Your-Screen
This project is for my MIT xPro Coding Bootcamp. We are using a setInterval function to move a PacMan across a page and returning it back across once it reaches the page boundaries. 

Furture Improvements: As I learn more, I plan to make this more interactive by allowing the user to move pac man around the screen with buttons, or mouse movement. This will make the expereince more interactive for the user
